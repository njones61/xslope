# Spike: Newton-Raphson SSRM with a consistent tangent

Branch `nr-ssrm-spike`. Time-boxed experiment, not a product change.

## The question

XSLOPE's SSRM drives each strength-reduction trial with a viscoplastic
(initial-stiffness) iteration: the elastic stiffness is factorized once and
reused, and plastic stress is redistributed as a body-force correction until the
out-of-balance settles. The scheme is unconditionally robust in the sense that
it never needs a tangent, but its convergence rate is linear and it degrades
badly near failure. On the LEM-3 tutorial model
(`docs/lem/files/xslope_simple_mult_layers.xlsx`, E = 167,100 / nu = 0.45 and
E = 668,300 / nu = 0.40) an SSRM takes about 520 s and leaves two edge trials
undecided at the 50,000-iteration ceiling with the out-of-balance still falling.
The owner's position: "the last thing I want is even more than 50K iterations."

Does a global Newton-Raphson iteration with a consistent (algorithmic) tangent
do better on plain Mohr-Coulomb?

## Scope, as ruled by the owner

- Plain Mohr-Coulomb only. No strain softening. No tension cutoff coupling
  beyond what the existing path already does.
- psi = 0 (non-associated flow), so the consistent tangent is non-symmetric.
- No UI work.
- Both solvers live behind an internal switch; the viscoplastic path stays the
  default and stays byte-identical.
- Productize later only on a clear win.

## Success criterion (verbatim)

- **Correctness**: on every benchmark, N-R's SSRM factor of safety agrees with
  the viscoplastic answer within the bisection tolerance (0.01 on F), and with
  the repo's locked values where tags exist.
- **Robustness**: every trial the bisection visits either converges or is
  declared failed by a criterion that matches the viscoplastic verdict for that
  F (no trial left "inconclusive"); specifically the two edge trials the LEM-3
  case leaves undecided at 50,000 iterations must be decided.
- **Speed**: iterations per trial in the tens to low hundreds, not tens of
  thousands; whole-SSRM wall time at most one fifth of the viscoplastic run on
  the same machine, same mesh, same bracket.
- **Time-box**: if by the end of this session the approach is not clearly
  meeting the criterion, write the honest negative result and stop — that is a
  valid outcome.

| LEM-3 tutorial | `docs/lem/files/xslope_simple_mult_layers.xlsx` | no SSRM tag; the slow case |

Plus deliberate hard-regime probes: a trial well past failure, and nu = 0.49.

## What was built

`fem_solver='viscoplastic'` (the default) or `'newton'`, on both `solve_fem` and
`solve_ssrm`, overridable for a whole run by `XSLOPE_FEM_SOLVER`. The switch is
read in exactly one place — the point in `solve_fem` where the trial strengths
are known — and the viscoplastic path falls through it untouched.

The Newton path itself:

- **Return mapping.** Closest-point return to the Mohr-Coulomb cone in
  principal-stress space, tension-positive, with the main plane, the two sextant
  corners (two-vector returns) and the tensile apex. Written on the ordered
  principal stresses the yield function is linear, and with psi = 0 the isotropic
  elastic operator maps the flow direction to twice the shear modulus times
  itself, so the main-plane multiplier is exactly `f/mu` and each corner is a 2x2
  solve. The return is therefore linear in the trial stress on every branch.
- **Apex.** With psi = 0 every return direction is deviatoric, so none of them
  changes the mean stress. A trial state whose mean stress is already past the
  apex cannot be returned to the cone at all, and the only admissible point is
  the apex itself. This is the case the viscoplastic scheme cannot resolve — its
  psi = 0 flow chases a yield function that never closes, which is why that path
  carries a separate Rankine surface for tensile states.
- **Consistent tangent.** Differentiated through the discrete return map, so it
  is the tangent of the map the residual actually uses. Elastic points carry the
  elastic operator exactly; yielded points are differenced in the three free
  strain components. Because each branch is linear in the trial stress, the
  quotient is exact on the branch and the only error is the smooth rotation of
  the principal frame.
- **Global iteration.** Newton-Raphson on the equilibrium residual with a
  backtracking line search, over adaptively sub-stepped gravity. psi = 0 makes
  the tangent non-symmetric, so the sparse solve is a general LU (SuperLU).
- **Verdict.** Binary by construction: the full gravity load is either reached in
  equilibrium — checked against the same Dawson, Roth & Drescher per-node measure
  the viscoplastic verdict is read on, here applied to the true residual — or the
  load increment is cut below its floor without reaching it, which is the limit
  point. No trial can come back inconclusive.
- **Scope.** Plain Mohr-Coulomb only. Reinforcement, piles, Hoek-Brown and
  power-curve envelopes, matric suction, tension caps, K0 initial stress and
  staged loading raise rather than being silently ignored.

Two things in the implementation are worth naming because they decided whether
the speed criterion was met at all. The assembly pattern is fixed for a whole
solve, so it is built once and each tangent re-form is a single `bincount` into a
ready-made CSC structure; rebuilding a COO matrix and re-sorting it every
iteration cost as much as the factorization it fed (FEM-1 went from 16.8 s to
9.4 s on that change alone). And a load increment is abandoned as soon as its
residual stops halving over six iterations, rather than being ground out to the
iteration cap — near the limit load a failing attempt converges linearly at a
rate approaching 1, which is the signal itself.
