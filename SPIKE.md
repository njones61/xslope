# Spike: Newton-Raphson SSRM with a consistent tangent

Branch `nr-ssrm-spike`. Time-boxed experiment, not a product change.

## The question

XSLOPE's SSRM drives each strength-reduction trial with a viscoplastic
(initial-stiffness) iteration: the elastic stiffness is factorized once and
reused, and plastic stress is redistributed as a body-force correction until the
out-of-balance settles. The scheme is unconditionally robust in the sense that
it never needs a tangent, but its convergence rate is linear and it degrades
badly near failure. On the LEM-3 tutorial model
(`docs/lem/files/xslope_simple_mult_layers.xlsx`, E = 167,100 / nu = 0.45 and
E = 668,300 / nu = 0.40) an SSRM takes about 520 s and leaves two edge trials
undecided at the 50,000-iteration ceiling with the out-of-balance still falling.
The owner's position: "the last thing I want is even more than 50K iterations."

Does a global Newton-Raphson iteration with a consistent (algorithmic) tangent
do better on plain Mohr-Coulomb?

## Scope, as ruled by the owner

- Plain Mohr-Coulomb only. No strain softening. No tension cutoff coupling
  beyond what the existing path already does.
- psi = 0 (non-associated flow), so the consistent tangent is non-symmetric.
- No UI work.
- Both solvers live behind an internal switch; the viscoplastic path stays the
  default and stays byte-identical.
- Productize later only on a clear win.

## Success criterion (verbatim)

- **Correctness**: on every benchmark, N-R's SSRM factor of safety agrees with
  the viscoplastic answer within the bisection tolerance (0.01 on F), and with
  the repo's locked values where tags exist.
- **Robustness**: every trial the bisection visits either converges or is
  declared failed by a criterion that matches the viscoplastic verdict for that
  F (no trial left "inconclusive"); specifically the two edge trials the LEM-3
  case leaves undecided at 50,000 iterations must be decided.
- **Speed**: iterations per trial in the tens to low hundreds, not tens of
  thousands; whole-SSRM wall time at most one fifth of the viscoplastic run on
  the same machine, same mesh, same bracket.
- **Time-box**: if by the end of this session the approach is not clearly
  meeting the criterion, write the honest negative result and stop — that is a
  valid outcome.

## Benchmarks to measure

| Case | File | Lock |
|---|---|---|
| FEM-1 tutorial | `docs/tutorials/files/xslope_ssrm_embankment.xlsx` | FS 1.3633, tri6, size 3.5, bracket 1.0-2.0 |
| LEM-3 tutorial | `docs/lem/files/xslope_simple_mult_layers.xlsx` | no SSRM tag; the slow case (E/nu from the elastic-property classifier: 167,100/0.45 and 668,300/0.40) |
| Griffiths 6 dry | `docs/fem/files/xslope_griffiths6_dry.xlsx` | FS 2.422, quad8, size 2, bracket 2.0-2.8 |
| Griffiths 1 | `docs/fem/files/xslope_griffiths1.xlsx` | FS 1.359, quad8, size 3.5, bracket 1.0-1.8 |
| Griffiths 3 r0.8 | `docs/fem/files/xslope_griffiths3_r0p8.xlsx` | FS 1.41, tri6, size 6, bracket 1.0-1.8 |

Plus deliberate hard-regime probes: a trial well past failure, and nu = 0.49.

## What was built

`fem_solver='viscoplastic'` (the default) or `'newton'`, on both `solve_fem` and
`solve_ssrm`, overridable for a whole run by `XSLOPE_FEM_SOLVER`. The switch is
read in exactly one place — the point in `solve_fem` where the trial strengths
are known — and the viscoplastic path falls through it untouched.

The Newton path itself:

- **Return mapping.** Closest-point return to the Mohr-Coulomb cone in
  principal-stress space, tension-positive, with the main plane, the two sextant
  corners (two-vector returns) and the tensile apex. Written on the ordered
  principal stresses the yield function is linear, and with psi = 0 the isotropic
  elastic operator maps the flow direction to twice the shear modulus times
  itself, so the main-plane multiplier is exactly `f/mu` and each corner is a 2x2
  solve. The return is therefore linear in the trial stress on every branch.
- **Apex.** With psi = 0 every return direction is deviatoric, so none of them
  changes the mean stress. A trial state whose mean stress is already past the
  apex cannot be returned to the cone at all, and the only admissible point is
  the apex itself. This is the case the viscoplastic scheme cannot resolve — its
  psi = 0 flow chases a yield function that never closes, which is why that path
  carries a separate Rankine surface for tensile states.
- **Consistent tangent.** Differentiated through the discrete return map, so it
  is the tangent of the map the residual actually uses. Elastic points carry the
  elastic operator exactly; yielded points are differenced in the three free
  strain components. Because each branch is linear in the trial stress, the
  quotient is exact on the branch and the only error is the smooth rotation of
  the principal frame.
- **Global iteration.** Newton-Raphson on the equilibrium residual with a
  backtracking line search, over adaptively sub-stepped gravity. psi = 0 makes
  the tangent non-symmetric, so the sparse solve is a general LU (SuperLU).
- **Verdict.** Binary by construction: the full gravity load is either reached in
  equilibrium — checked against the same Dawson, Roth & Drescher per-node measure
  the viscoplastic verdict is read on, here applied to the true residual — or the
  load increment is cut below its floor without reaching it, which is the limit
  point. No trial can come back inconclusive.
- **Scope.** Plain Mohr-Coulomb only. Reinforcement, piles, Hoek-Brown and
  power-curve envelopes, matric suction, tension caps, K0 initial stress and
  staged loading raise rather than being silently ignored.

One implementation detail is worth naming because it decided whether the speed
criterion was in reach at all. The assembly pattern is fixed for a whole solve,
so it is built once and each tangent re-form is a single `bincount` into a
ready-made CSC structure; rebuilding a COO matrix and re-sorting it every
iteration cost as much as the factorization it fed, and dropping that took FEM-1
from 16.8 s to 9.4 s on its own.

The step control went through two settings, and which one is in force changes the
answers, not just the run time. That is the subject of its own section below.

## Results

All runs on the same machine, the same mesh and the same bracket for both
drivers, `capture_failure_state=False`, hybrid failure criterion, `force_tol`
1e-3. The compiled Mohr-Coulomb kernel is not built in this checkout, so both
drivers ran the pure-NumPy path — a fair comparison, and one that flatters
Newton, because an installed build accelerates the viscoplastic constitutive
update and not the Newton assembly.

### The LEM-3 edge trials

This is the case the spike was commissioned on. The viscoplastic bisection
reaches the ceiling twice — F = 1.2656 and F = 1.2578, both at 50,000 iterations
with the residual still falling, both reported as the bracket's upper
uncertainty rather than as measured failures. The whole run takes 796.5 s and
169,767 iterations.

Newton decides both. F = 1.2656 fails in 100 iterations, F = 1.2578 in 118, each
by driving the load increment below its floor — the limit point, not an
exhausted budget. The run takes 378.1 s and 2,630 iterations, and every trial it
visits comes back converged or failed.

The same holds on the Griffiths & Lane 3 case, whose F = 1.425 trial the
viscoplastic path leaves undecided at 50,000 iterations and Newton decides in
130.

### The step control decides the answer

The most important measurement in this spike is not in the tables above. It is
that two settings of the Newton *step control* — knobs with no physical meaning
— produce two different sets of factors of safety, and the fast setting is the
wrong one.

An earlier configuration abandoned a load increment unless its residual halved
every six iterations, and, when no backtracked step reduced the residual, took
an untested smaller one anyway. That configuration ran the table above at 4.7x
to 9.8x — the speed criterion comfortably met — and returned FS = 1.754 on the
dry dam against a locked 2.422.

That answer is provably wrong, and the proof does not depend on either solver
being right. The viscoplastic field at F = 2.4 is in exact equilibrium and
violates the yield surface by 0.22% of the cohesion at its worst Gauss point:
a statically admissible stress field, which is a lower-bound proof that the
slope stands at F = 2.4. Driving the Newton residual at the full gravity load
from a zero start reaches that same equilibrium in 26 iterations, with the
relative residual falling 1.00, 0.141, 0.139, 0.135, 0.127, 0.126 — a plateau
ten iterations long while the active set churns — and then 4.1e-3, 5.9e-5,
9.4e-8, 1.1e-12. The halving rule cut the solve off mid-plateau. The untested
line-search step was worse: with a near-singular tangent it drove the
displacement to 4.6e13 times the elastic response in one iteration.

Both were fixed (commit "the Newton step control stops manufacturing failures"),
and the fix is what the tables above measure. Correcting them moved the dry dam
from 1.754 to 2.4186 and cost most of the speed: the same benchmark went from
37 s to 102 s, which is slower than the viscoplastic run it was meant to beat.

The lesson generalizes past this implementation. A criterion of the form "the
solver could not reach equilibrium" is only as trustworthy as the rule that
decides when to stop trying, and that rule is a tuning parameter. The
viscoplastic path has the same exposure — its budget extension, its
displacement-evidence classifier and its early-failure thresholds are exactly
this kind of rule — but they have years of calibration behind them, and this
spike's do not.

### The hard regimes

**Well past failure.** On FEM-1 at F = 2, 3 and 5 the two drivers return the same
verdict every time, and Newton is 20 to 30 times SLOWER. This is where load
control has nothing to offer: there is no equilibrium path past the limit point,
so Newton spends its whole budget cutting the increment in half and re-solving —
323, 399 and 246 iterations for 8.8 s, 10.8 s and 7.0 s, against the
viscoplastic path's 181, 81 and 51 iterations for 0.4 s, 0.3 s and 0.3 s. The
viscoplastic early-failure rule recognizes a gross runaway within a few hundred
iterations and closes the trial; Newton has to prove the load is unreachable by
failing to reach it at every increment size down to the floor. The deeper past
failure the trial is, the worse the ratio gets — the opposite of what a solver
wants, since a bisection with a bad initial bracket visits exactly those trials.

**nu = 0.49.** No breakdown. On FEM-1 with every material at nu = 0.49 the two
drivers agree on the verdict at F = 1.0, 1.30, 1.36 (both stable) and 1.40, 1.50
(both failed), and the stable trials are the cheapest Newton solves in this whole
spike — 11 or 12 iterations each, against 120 to 441 viscoplastic ones. Near
incompressibility hurts the tangent's conditioning in principle; it did not hurt
it here, because the tri6 element has enough freedom to carry the near-isochoric
plastic strain and the consistent tangent inherits that. Failing trials cost
what they cost everywhere else: 227 to 296 iterations, 6 to 8 s, against 0.8 to
2.8 s viscoplastic.

**Reduced integration.** Griffiths & Lane 1 is the one case measured on all three
quadratic element types. Newton matches the viscoplastic answer exactly on tri6,
is 0.0063 away on quad8 and 0.0125 away on quad9. The quad8's 2x2 reduced
integration leaves four Gauss points to constrain thirteen deformation modes, and
a fully plastic Mohr-Coulomb tangent is rank-deficient at each of them, so the
element tangent loses rank where the viscoplastic path — which always solves with
the elastic operator — cannot. The gap is small here, but the mechanism is real
and quad8 is the default element type.

## The criterion, line by line

**Correctness — PARTLY MET.** Five of the eight runs agree with the viscoplastic
answer inside the 0.01 bisection tolerance (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0033, 0.0063,
0.0078). Three do not: Griffiths & Lane 1 on quad9 at 0.0125, LEM-3 at 0.0156,
and Griffiths & Lane 3 at 0.0250. Against the locks: FEM-1 (1.3633, tolerance
0.01) passes at 0.0078; Griffiths & Lane 6 dry (2.422, tolerance 0.01) passes at
0.0034; Griffiths & Lane 3 (1.41, tolerance 0.05) passes at 0.0275; Griffiths &
Lane 1 (1.359, tolerance 0.01) misses at 0.0129 — though the viscoplastic driver
on the same rebuilt mesh reads 1.3656, itself 0.0066 from the lock, so about half
of that miss is the mesh and not the driver. Newton reads HIGH on every case
where the two differ, without exception.

**Robustness — MET.** Every trial on every Newton run came back converged or
failed; the word 'inconclusive' does not appear once. The two LEM-3 edge trials
the viscoplastic path leaves undecided at 50,000 iterations are decided in 100
and 118 iterations, and so is the Griffiths & Lane 3 trial at F = 1.425, in 130.
This is the criterion the spike was commissioned to test, and it is the one
Newton clears cleanly.

**Speed — NOT MET.** The requirement is a whole-SSRM wall time at most a fifth of
the viscoplastic run. The measured ratios are 2.2x, 2.1x, 3.1x, 2.6x, 4.4x, 1.3x,
1.1x and 0.6x — the last of those slower than the run it replaces. Iterations per
trial land in the low hundreds, with worst trials of 440 to 647, which is at the
edge of "tens to low hundreds" rather than inside it. Two qualifications make the
picture worse rather than better: the compiled Mohr-Coulomb kernel is not built
in this checkout, and an installed build accelerates the viscoplastic
constitutive update while leaving the Newton assembly alone; and past failure the
ratio inverts to 20-30x against Newton.

**Time-box — the honest negative is written above and here.**

## Verdict

Do not productize this yet.

Newton-Raphson with a consistent Mohr-Coulomb tangent does the one thing the
viscoplastic scheme cannot: it gives every trial a verdict. Both LEM-3 edge
trials, and the Griffiths & Lane 3 trial, that the viscoplastic path abandons at
50,000 iterations with the residual still falling are decided here in about a
hundred iterations each, on the right side, because "the load increment cannot be
carried" is a statement about the slope and "the budget ran out" is a statement
about the solver. On five of eight benchmarks it reproduces the viscoplastic
factor of safety inside the bisection tolerance, twice exactly, and it holds up
at nu = 0.49. That is a real result and it is the reason to keep this branch.

What it does not do is go five times faster. It goes two to four times faster on
most cases, the same speed on two, and slower on one — and 20 to 30 times slower
on trials well past failure, which is precisely where a bisection with a poor
initial bracket spends its early work. Worse, the speed and the correctness are
the same knob. The configuration that met the speed criterion, at 4.7x to 9.8x,
returned 1.754 on a dam that provably stands at 2.42; the configuration that
gets the dam right gives most of that speed back. A solver whose factor of safety
moves by two thirds when a convergence-abandonment threshold is retuned is not
ready to define anyone's answer, and three benchmarks still sit outside the
bisection tolerance — all of them high, which is the unconservative direction.

The fallback design the owner sketched is the right shape and this measurement
supports it: Newton as the per-trial default, an automatic per-trial fall back to
the viscoplastic solve whenever Newton reports failure, and a configuration
escape hatch to pin either driver. That arrangement takes the win where it is
real — a converged Newton trial is fast, and a converged trial is a positive
answer no fallback can improve — while a Newton failure, which is the verdict
this spike showed to be tuning-sensitive, is never trusted on its own. It also
inverts the cost profile the measurements above expose: today a Newton failure is
the expensive case, and under the fallback it would be a cheap pre-filter in
front of the viscoplastic trial that decides it. Before any of that is built,
three things need doing: close the three benchmarks still outside tolerance and
find out whether the residual is the loading path, the reduced-integration
tangent, or a return-map branch; give the Newton failure verdict the kind of
calibration the viscoplastic thresholds have, measured across the corpus rather
than on eight cases; and either extend the return map to the features it now
refuses — reinforcement, piles, tension caps, Hoek-Brown, suction, K0, staged
loading — or accept that the fallback carries every model that uses them.

## Reproducing this

```
XSLOPE_FEM_SOLVER=newton python3 ...        # whole run on the Newton driver
solve_ssrm(fem_data, ..., fem_solver='newton')
solve_fem(fem_data, F=1.4, fem_solver='newton', debug_level=3)   # per-iteration trace
```

`test/nr_ssrm_check.py` (suite row `nr_ssrm`) runs Griffiths & Lane Example 1 at
a coarse tri6 mesh through both drivers and asserts they agree with each other
and with the locked 1.39, and that Newton decided every trial.

The default path is unchanged. Griffiths & Lane 6 dry re-run with no
`fem_solver` argument after all of the above returns FS = 2.421875 against the
locked 2.422, with per-trial iteration counts 147, 781, 3393, 2031, 2841, 9541,
16000, 8617, 8777 — identical to the same run made before the Newton driver
existed.
