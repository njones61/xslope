# THE TIME BASE OF EACH STEADY CASE
#
# Every model here carries a conductivity, and a conductivity is a length over a
# TIME, so each file declares the base its k is written in (the 'main' sheet's Time
# selector).  The base is read off the vendor model, per case, never inherited from
# a sibling: RS2 stores k in whatever base the model's own ``TimeUnit`` names, and
# the set is not uniform -- ``#019``/``#020`` are hours and ``#021`` is minutes, and
# their k values are the m/hr and m/min numbers to match (see the transient tiers
# below, which already declare theirs).
#
# For the STEADY tier the vendor is unanimous.  Every one of ``groundwater #001``
# through ``#013`` declares ``TimeUnit: second`` and ``metric permeability:
# "meters/second"`` in its own ``.fea``, and each builder's k is that model's own
# ``SK`` / conductivity-table value at face value in that base -- #002's 1e-05,
# #009_01's 6.67e-06, #010's 1.1574e-05, #011's 1e-07, #012's 1e-05, #013's 0.001,
# and the m/s fluxes the manual prints for #001 (2.5e-6), #007 (2.1e-4) and #008
# (4.4444e-5).  So all thirteen declare ``sec``.
#
# GW9 dam 1 is the case worth naming, because the page reports its discharge in
# m3/(min*m): that is a CONVERSION for comparison with Bowles, who works the dam in
# m/min.  The file's own conductivity is the vendor's 6.67e-6 m/s, and the locked
# flowrate 2.3069e-05 is the per-second number the page's 1.384e-3 is sixty times.
# Its declared base is therefore ``sec``, like every other steady case; labelling it
# per minute would put a unit on the figure that its own printed Q contradicts.

    Slide model converted to RS2 - whose mesh boundary polygon is
    (0,0)-(10,5)-(12.5,5)-(23.4857,1.5016)-(21.9,0).  The dam is NOT closed
    by a vertical face: its downstream slope runs past the printed dimension
    chain to (23.4857, 1.5016) and then falls back down-left on the drain's
    inclined contact face to the toe at (21.9, 0).  Fig 4.1 shows the
    trapezoidal drain that face bounds, Fig 4.2's right-hand end shows the
    face itself carrying the seepage-face markers, and the printed
    10.00 + 2.50 + 9.50 = 22.00 chain measures to the BASE TOE, not to the
    rightmost point of the downstream slope.

    Boundary conditions likewise from the vendor file: total head 4 on the
    submerged upstream face (its nodal cards span x 0..8.019, y 0..4.009);
    a potential seepage face over the dry upstream face, the crest, the
    downstream slope AND the drain contact; and one node pinned to total
    head 0 at the drain toe (21.900, 0.000).  ks = 1e-7 m/s from the
    vendor's ``groundwater_material_properties`` (the free-surface shape is
    k-independent, so ks sets the flowrate lock only).

    The unsaturated law is an ASSUMPTION, not a transcription: the vendor
    material carries ``gw_mode 0 / stype General``, RS2's built-in Simple
    curve, whose parameters the file does not store.  A linear front with
    kr0 = 1e-3 at 0.25 m of suction stands in for it.

    Targets (Table 4.1): y1, the free-surface height directly above the
    drain toe, and x1, the horizontal offset from that toe to where the free
    surface meets the drain face.  RS2 publishes its own solve of THIS file
    (0.395 / 0.226), Slide publishes 0.442 / 0.227 for the same model, and

    correction on the vendor's m = 8.0187, h = 4.0094, focus x = 21.900).

    where it enters the drain - so it needs a fine mesh: y1 reads 0.346 /

    1995), the manual's two-material permeability-contrast problem.  Geometry,
    materials and boundary cards are read verbatim from the vendor RS2 model
    (``groundwater #005.fez``, linked from the manual's own section 5.5), so
    nothing here is digitized: external boundary (0,0)-(30,0)-(40,0)-(40,2)-
    (30,2)-(30,10)-(0,10)-(0,0) — a 30 x 10 m block with a 2 m downstream shelf
    out to x=40 — and two internal material boundaries at y=6 and y=4 spanning
    x=0..30, i.e. a 2 m low-k lens through the block.  Saturated conductivities
    are the manual's printed pair (1e-10 m/s host, 1e-13 m/s lens, a 1000x
    contrast); total head 10 m on the whole left face and 4 m on the x=30 step
    face (y 2..4) plus the x=40 end (y 0..2); every other edge is no-flow, and
    the vendor sets no seepage face anywhere.

    Both vendor k(psi) functions are two-point CONSTANT curves (kr = 1 at
    psi = -1000 and at +1000), so despite the section title the vendor model is a
    constant-conductivity linear problem; kr0=1.0 reproduces that exactly and
    the unsaturated law never enters.  The lens is 1000x tighter than the host,
    so it isolates the upper block, which stagnates near total head 10 while the
    head below it falls linearly 10 -> 4 across the 30 m.

    Published target: Figure 5-4, a pressure-head contour plate carrying a
    numeric key (0 -> 10 m in ten 1 m bands) — chart-only, no tabulated value,
    the same situation the methodology note covers for GW6/GW7 — so xslope's own
    flowrate and total-head field are locked and the Fig 5-4 comparison is
    documented in the page.  Two independent checks: the flow is essentially
    one-dimensional through the 4 m below the lens, so k*b*i = 1e-10*4*(6/30) =
    8.0e-11 m3/s per m, and xslope reads 8.19/8.17/8.14e-11 over a tri3 1.0 ->
    tri3 0.5 -> tri6 0.5 ladder (+1.8% at the finest, 0.6% spread); against the
    vendor, the solved pressure head lands inside Fig 5-4's own 1 m band at 46
    of 49 grid points, the three exceptions missing a band edge by 0.003, 0.008
    and 0.025 m.

    WATER LOADS STAY MANUAL — a recorded exception. Two pools at different levels
    (10 m upstream, 4 m on the shelf) meet at the vertical step face at x = 30, and
    a water surface is a function of position: it can hold one elevation at that
    station, not two, so the automatic derivation loads the whole step from the
    upstream level and floods the shelf. The derivation says so rather than doing it

#
# The source is the vendor's own model file rather than the Fig 6.2 chart: every

# function as a table, and case 1's is four points of pressure head (m) against
# conductivity (m/s) --
#
#     -15: 1e-11    -10: 1e-10    -1: 1e-07    -0: 1e-07
#
# so ks = 1e-7 m/s, air entry 1 m (9.81 kPa), then log-linear in suction: -1/3
# decade per metre to psi = 10 m, -1/5 decade per metre to psi = 15 m.  Case 2's
# table is the same shape scaled by 9, case 3's is the same function sampled at
# every metre (16 points) with its core 100x lower, and cases 4 and 5 repeat
# case 1's exactly.  Digitizing Fig 6.2 recovers the same curve to 0.007 decades
# rms, so the chart and the table agree; the table is used because it is exact.
#
# XSLOPE carries van Genuchten, Gardner and linear-front laws, not a table, so
# the function is fit.  These are the least-squares Mualem-vG parameters in
# log10(kr) over 0-8 m of suction -- the band the five solved fields occupy

    falling on the exposed surface while the toe drain still runs. Same 12 m
    dam, 2:1 faces, 12 m toe drain, reservoir at 10 m, case-1 material.

    The vendor model (groundwater #006_04.slw) applies the infiltration as
    fourteen traction cards, each a VERTICAL flux of 1e-8 m/s, over the surface
    from (22, 11) up across the crest and down the downstream face to (50, 1) —
    one element short of the fixed-head node at each end. A vertical rain rate
    is not the same number as the normal flux XSLOPE's flux BC takes: on the
    2:1 faces the vendor's own cards carry qn = 1e-8 * cos(atan 0.5) = 8.9443e-9,
    and only across the horizontal crest is qn the full 1e-8. So the surface goes
    in as three blocks at the vendor's two rates, and the assembled inflow is the
    rain rate times the 28 m horizontal footprint, 2.800000e-7 m3/s per m, to
    seven figures. The face rate goes in exact rather than rounded — at
    8.94427191e-9 a two-figure 8.9e-9 would leave the boundary 0.6% light.

    The drain is XSLOPE's exit face, as on cases 1-3. The vendor writes it as a
    specified head of 0; in XSLOPE that would leave the model with no exit face
    at all, which selects the confined solver and drops the unsaturated law the
    problem is about.

    Target: pressure head along line 1-1 (x=26) from Fig 6.18, which prints
    Slide and Ref[1] markers at every metre of elevation. Infiltration lifts the
    profile 0.65 m above case 1 at the base and 1.33 m at the crest. xslope

    first specified-flux (Neumann) problem. Fig 8.1 (p.34): half-drain
    spacing 1.0 m wide, 0.5 m deep to the impermeable base, two layers -
    Soil A is the LOWER 0.1 m (coarse) and Soil B the upper 0.4 m (fine).
    The water-free ditch is the left wall: exit face over its full height,
    so the invert node carries zero head when active (Slide draws the same
    thing as "seepage face" + "zero head" at the invert). Base and
    right-hand symmetry edge are no-flow, i.e. simply unspecified.

    MATERIAL AND FLUX VALUES COME FROM THE VENDOR MODEL, not from the
    printed tables, on two inputs where the two disagree:

    * Infiltration.  Both manuals' text prints 4.4e-6 m/s; the vendor model
      (``groundwater #008.fez``, 20 'vert infilt' edges over the whole top
      boundary) carries **4.4444e-5 m/s**.  The units of that card are fixed
      by two problems whose printed flux is not in dispute - #001_01 carries
      2.5e-6 (manual P = 2.5e-6 m/s) and #007 carries 2.1e-4 (manual
      2.1e-4 m/s) - so 'vert infilt' is the distributed flux in m/s.  The
      vendor value is also the clean one: 4.4444e-5 m/s = 0.16 m/hr and
      q/k_B = 0.400 exactly, where the printed value is clean in nothing.
      Decisive check: two-layer Dupuit at the symmetry divide gives a
      0.063 m mound from the printed flux and 0.240 m from the vendor's,
      and Figs 8.3/8.4 both draw the water table at ~0.25 m there.

    * Gardner a for Soil B.  Both manuals' Table 8.1 prints 2777.7; the
      vendor model carries **277.777**.  Discriminated on Fig 8.3's own
      labelled pressure-head contours (-0.10/-0.14/-0.17/-0.20 m, digitized
      at five stations): a = 277.777 reproduces all 14 station values to
      0.010 m rms / 0.019 m worst, while a = 2777.7 never gets below
      -0.16 m of suction, so it cannot draw the -0.17 or -0.20 contours the
      figure shows at all, and lands 0.030 m rms on the two it can.

    Saturated conductivities are likewise the vendor's exact 1.111111e-3
    (Soil A) and 1.111111e-4 m/s (Soil B) rather than the tables' rounded
    1.11e-3/1.11e-4; Soil A's Gardner pair (a = 1000, n = 4.5) and Soil B's
    n = 4.2 agree between print and model.

    and the Fig 8.4 total-head contours plus its drawn water table."""

#
# All three are modelled as SATURATED columns/strips: the excess pore pressure
# (or aquifer head rise) is carried on a datum-offset total head H_REF so the
# pressure head stays positive everywhere and storage is Ss throughout (the
# variably-saturated solver then runs on the linear, saturated branch, which is
# exactly the diffusion equation dh/dt = (K/Ss) grad^2 h = cv grad^2 h).  The
# uniform non-steady initial condition is set with the repeated-time step-series
# idiom (value at t=0 -> the t=0 steady solve gives the uniform IC; the stepped
# value drives t>0), the same device the erfc acceptance lock uses — so no
# h_init tag key is needed and the tseep sheet alone carries the transient model.

# faces, profile (0,0)-(24,12)-(28,12)-(52,0)), now with STORAGE (Ss = gamma_w*mv)
# and a moving reservoir face.  GW#18 has a free downstream seepage face (no
# drain); GW#17 adds a 12 m toe drain (a high-k strip held at total head 0).
#
# Unsaturated properties: each vendor model carries a "user defined groundwater
# function" with TWO independent tables - a conductivity curve k(suction) and a
# water-content curve theta(suction) - with suction in kPa and k in m/s.  They are
# transcribed separately, not derived from one another:
#
#   GW#18 (RS2 #020)   k: (0, 1e-7) (5, 1e-7) (100, 1e-10)   theta: (0, 0.7) (4000, 0.4)
#   GW#17 (RS2 #019)   k: (0, 1e-7) (15, 1e-7) (50, 5e-9)    theta: (0, 0.4) (100, 0.1)
#                         (100, 1e-10) (200, 1e-12)
#
# GW#18's retention curve spreads its 0.3 of water content over 4000 kPa - 408 m of
# head, a hundred times the scale of any van Genuchten fit to its conductivity curve
# - so its moisture capacity CANNOT be carried by the same (a, n) that carries kr.
# It is built on ``unsat='gard'`` instead, where XSLOPE takes kr from the Gardner
# power law and the drainage capacity from an independent linear band Sy/|h0|: a
# straight retention line over its own range is exactly what that band is, so
# Sy = 0.7 - 0.4 and h0 = -4000/gamma_w reproduce the vendor curve rather than fit
# it.  The Gardner fit to GW#18's own conductivity table is also the better of the
# two (0.120 vs 0.161 decades rms over 0-12 m of suction).
#
# GW#17's retention range is 100 kPa (10 m), the same order as its conductivity
# curve, so the van Genuchten capacity is adequate there and its Mualem-vG
# conductivity fit is twice as good as a Gardner one (0.055 vs 0.113 decades rms
# over 0-20 m); it keeps the vG model.

# above the water line become exit-face nodes.  tri3 mesh (the transient exit-face

def gw019():
    """GW#19 (RS2 #21): transient seepage BELOW A LAGOON.  A half-model (the lagoon
    centerline at x=0 is a no-flow symmetry plane), 19 m wide x 10 m deep, of a
    two-layer aquifer: a 1 m soil LINER across the top (y in [9,10], lower k) over
    9 m of SOIL (y in [0,9]).  A 2 m-wide lagoon (x in [0,2] at the surface y=10)
    is filled with 1 m of water at t=0 and leaks down through the liner.

    From the vendor RS2 model (groundwater #021 .slw): both materials m_v=0.002,
    porosity 0.7; soil Custom k(psi) k_s=6e-4 (down to 6e-6 by 10 m suction), liner
    k_s=3.54e-4 (same relative shape).  TimeUnit=minute, so k is m/min and the
    schedule is in minutes.  Storage S_s = gamma_w*m_v = 10*0.002 = 0.02 /m (the
    vendor model carries pore_fluid_uw=10), S_y = theta_s - theta_r = 0.7-0.5 = 0.2.

    Built on the GW#18 split (``unsat='gard'``, see the block comment above), which
    both vendor tables here support REPRODUCING rather than fitting:

      * conductivity -- the .slw table is three points in metres of head,
        kr(0)=1, kr(5 m)=0.1, kr(10 m)=0.01, identical in relative shape for the
        soil and the liner.  Gardner kr = 1/(1+a*psi^n) through the two non-trivial
        points is exact: n = ln(11)/ln(2) = 3.45943, a = 9/5^n = 0.034372.  (The
        Mualem-vG pair this replaces, vg_a=0.1734/vg_n=1.9124, was a fit -- it
        returns kr = 0.095 and 0.0128 at those two points.)
      * retention -- the .slw water-content table is TWO points in kPa,
        (0, 0.7) -> (100, 0.5), i.e. a straight line, which is exactly the linear
        drainage band Sy/|h0| that ``gard`` uses for capacity: Sy = 0.2 over
        h0 = -100/10 = -10 m.

    NOTE the two tables are written in DIFFERENT units in the .slw -- conductivity
    against head in metres, water content against pressure in kPa.  The sibling
    models make this unambiguous: '#020' and '#022' write conductivity abscissae of
    -10.1936799184506 / -0.509683995922528 / -3.05810397553517, which are 100 / 5 /
    30 kPa divided by their gamma_w = 9.81, while their water-content abscissae stay
    round (-4000, -100).  Here gamma_w = 10 exactly, so the converted conductivity
    heads come out round (-10, -5) and the distinction is easy to miss.  Both of
    this model's curves therefore span the SAME 10 m of head.

    The far field (right edge x=19, y in [0,5]) is held at total head 5 — the
    regional water table 5 m below the surface, which is also the initial condition:
    the t=0 steady solve at a lagoon head of 5 (equal to the far field) gives a
    uniform water table at el 5, then the lagoon steps to total head 11 (el 10 + 1 m

    series: at t=0 the lagoon nodes at y=10 sit above the head-5 water line and are

    the top away from the lagoon are no-flow.  Report times 73 / 416 / 792 / 11340 min

    Rulon & Freeze sandbox (2.4 x 1.0 m, a medium-sand slope with a thin fine-sand
    lens) re-run transiently as rainfall switches on at t=0.  Same geometry,
    materials and boundary layout as gw007(); the transient additions are storage
    (S_s = gamma_w*m_v) and a rainfall flux that is zero at t=0 and steps to the GW#7
    value 2.1e-4 m/s for t>0.

    The initial condition is the t=0 steady solve with NO infiltration: only the
    tailwater head 0.3 at the toe holds, so the water table sits at el 0.3 (0.1 m
    above the toe).  When rainfall (2.1e-4 m/s, above the fine sand's k_s=5.5e-5)
    switches on, water perches on the fine lens and the perched mound builds toward
    the GW#7 steady result.  Vendor stage schedule: report times 4.6 / 31 / 208 s
    (TimeUnit=second, k in m/s).  Storage S_s = gamma_w*m_v = 9.81*0.002 = 0.0196 /m,
    S_y = 0.3; the medium/fine Mualem-vG curves are GW#7's (unchanged).

    Published target: total head along a query line (Fig 22.7, vs Ref [1]) +
    total-head contours at the three times — chart-only.  XSLOPE's own solved heads
    at interior stations (the developing perched zone) are locked as a regression
    guard.  The late 208 s frame has essentially reached the GW#7 steady perched
    state (the medium-sand diffusion time over 1 m is ~14 s).  SWCC-mapping timing
    caveat applies to the early frames."""
