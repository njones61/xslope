# Verification and Validation

XSLOPE's three analysis modes — limit equilibrium, finite-element seepage, and
finite-element slope stability (SSRM) — are verified against a two-tier
benchmark suite:

1. **Analytical anchors** — problems with exact closed-form solutions, where
   agreement is limited only by discretization.
2. **Established-code and published cross-checks** — problems from the
   verification literature and from codes practitioners already trust, run on
   matched geometry and properties.

All benchmark models, build scripts, and runners are in the repository
(`benchmarks/` and the sample files under `docs/*/files/`), so every number
below can be regenerated, and the benchmarks are re-verified automatically
whenever XSLOPE changes.

Every comparison the suite runs is declared by a test tag on the page that
publishes it, so the corpus counts itself: `python3 tools/count_verification_cases.py`
prints how many tags, locked comparisons, locked values and distinct models
these pages currently hold, broken down by source.

## How the match dots are scored {#how-the-match-dots-are-scored}

Every corpus page's summary table carries a match dot per problem.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 | within 3% of the vendor and/or reference figure |
| 🟡 | 3–6% |
| 🔴 | more than 6% |
| 🟣 | in progress |
| <span class="nodata">⊘</span> | insufficient data or out of scope |

The dot scores the **match quality of what is locked**, not how much of a problem is built: a
partly built problem is scored on the stages that are built, and the partial or blocked detail is
in the row text. **Only same-method pairings derive a dot.** Most rows here are strength-reduction
rows, and their pairing is XSLOPE's SSRM against RS2's own SSR column — the same method under two
names; another program's strength-reduction factor (PLAXIS, Z-Soil, GEO FEM, a published FEM/FDM
referee) pairs the same way. On the rows verified with limit equilibrium instead
([#51](#p4-vp51), [#60](#rs2-60), [#61](#rs2-61) cases 1 and 3, [#68](#rs2-68)) the method the
source itself names governs, and where the source names no method the fallback is XSLOPE's Spencer
or Morgenstern-Price against the published headline value. A pairing whose two sides are different
methods is reported as information only and never governs a dot; neither does an unconstrained
XSLOPE search against an unconstrained search of the vendor's, since two programs' searches may
settle on different mechanisms, nor a band stitched together from several programs' answers. A
comparison is scored at the source's own precision, so a difference smaller than the source's
printed or figure resolution counts as a match. The problem's *published* answer — the
referee/consensus value, or the source author's own factor — is a reference authority in its own
right whatever engine produced it, as is a closed form, which governs only where XSLOPE is itself
within band of it. Where a row has more than one valid pairing the dot takes the **best of them**;
where a row locks several cases, the worst locked case sets it. These conventions apply to every
summary table on this page.

**How the tables show it.** Every valid pairing carries its difference inline, in parentheses,
computed source-relative, (XSLOPE − source) / source, to one decimal. Where a table gives each
authority a column of its own the difference sits beside the value it is measured against —
`RS2 SSRM 1.33 (−2.0%)`; where a table gives the authority one column and the readings several, it
sits beside each reading instead. So a column carries a percentage exactly when it is a pairing the
dot could rest on, and a column that is **cross-method** for the row shows bare values, because it
is context rather than a pairing. Against a published *range* the entry reads `(inside)` where
XSLOPE falls within it and otherwise carries the difference to the nearer bound. A source author's
numbers fall on either side of that line depending on how the source published them: a single
headline factor for the problem is the published answer and takes a percentage whatever engine
produced it (Low's factor at [#19](#rs2-19), Perry's at [#30](#rs2-30)), while a per-method table
from the same author is a set of method-specific values, so each entry stays bare (Yamagami &
Ueta's Bishop, Fredlund & Krahn's four methods).
