"""Spencer's system has more than one root; only one is a body of soil.

Spencer's assumption — every interslice force at the same inclination theta —
turns equilibrium into two equations in (F, theta). Those equations divide every
slice by

    m_alpha = 1 / [cos(alpha - theta) + sin(alpha - theta) tan(phi) / F]

whose denominator vanishes when theta stands a right angle away from a slice's
own base inclination, less the friction that base mobilizes. Past that point the
slice's base normal has reversed, and roots there are common. They are not
solutions: they read low, and they read low by factors, not by percentages.

WHAT WENT WRONG

The solver descended from a handful of starting guesses and reported whichever
root it reached. Its Newton stage clipped theta into the pole-free band; its
scipy stage did not, and on a non-circular surface refined out of the seismic
benchmark VP104's own circular critical it walked outside the band and returned
F = 0.577 at theta = -16.3 degrees, where Morgenstern-Price with f(x) = 1 — the
same equations, solved a different way — reads 2.690 on the identical slices.
The force-equilibrium closure then inherited it: `_force_closure_root` breaks a
tie against the moment answer, which on a non-circular surface is Spencer's, so
Corps of Engineers reported 0.786 while its own warnings named an admissible root
five to nine times higher.

WHAT DECIDES WHICH ROOT

* theta stays inside the band where m_alpha keeps its sign on every slice. This
  is the geometric bound Spencer (1973) and Duncan & Wright describe — the
  interslice inclination lies between the inclinations of the ground surface and
  the slip surface — written in the form the equations give, and it is Spencer's
  form of the base factor `solve.FE_MIN_BASE_FACTOR` keeps clear of zero for the
  force-equilibrium closure.
* the largest interslice resultant stays within the total driving load on the
  mass (`solve.FE_MAX_Z_OVER_W` over `solve._driving_load`), and base tension
  does not saturate (`solve.MAX_BASE_TENSION_EXTENT`) — the closure's own two
  remaining measures, unchanged.
* where the cascade reaches no admissible root, the band is swept in (F, s)
  coordinates, s the position across the band, so a bounded descent cannot leave
  it; every crossing found is judged on the measures above and the survivors are
  tie-broken against the moment answer by ratio.

NO FIXED CAP ON THETA, and that is a measurement rather than a preference. A cap
at 45 degrees — the angle a real section's geometry rarely passes — refuses the
planar benchmark VP43 / GS-2.26, whose 1.352 at theta = 49.6 degrees is the value
Janbu, Corps, Lowe & Karafiath and Morgenstern-Price all return on the same
slices, and the wedge benchmark VP48, whose 0.991 at theta = -55.0 degrees is
likewise unanimous. Both sit inside the band their own geometry allows. Those two
are pinned below so the cap cannot come back.

A MAGNITUDE bar on the base factor is also deliberately absent here, for the same
kind of reason: VP104b's own circle solves at a base factor of 0.048, against
Bishop's 1.518 and Morgenstern-Price's 1.519 on the same slices, so the
force-equilibrium closure's 0.05 would refuse it. Spencer's roots are not wedged
between poles the way that march's are — the band already excludes those.

WHAT IS CHECKED

* the two refined VP104 surfaces: Spencer returns Morgenstern-Price's constant-f
  value to ten significant figures, at an interslice inclination inside the band;
* the roots passed over are named in results['warnings'] or in the refusal, with
  the measure each failed;
* the two benchmarks whose answers sit past 45 degrees still solve, at their
  locked values;
* the out-of-band refusal classifies as inadmissible, so a search reports it by
  class;
* a mutation: the band gate lifted, which puts the low out-of-band roots back.
