"""Mutation test for the verification-page checks.

A gate that certifies a wrong number is worse than no gate.  Each mutation
below plants one defect of a class the checks are supposed to catch, runs the
relevant check against the mutated page, and requires it to FAIL.  A mutation
that slips through is reported as MISSED and fails this suite.

The first block is the rs2 set the checks were originally hardened against.
The rest cover the check forms added when the other five pages were calibrated:
upper-bound percentages, scientific notation, thousands separators, share
lists, share rows, prefix-qualified quantities, the hedged-precision escape,
rounded tag restatements, scientific-notation tag values, list-valued locks
(one element of a printed row, one element of the tag, a partly published probe
set), and the structural figure mode.  The tag block also covers the
restatement pass: a section that prints its lock twice must agree with it both
times.

`NEGATIVE` runs the other way: edits that must NOT be flagged, so that a check
tightened against a defect cannot quietly start demanding that pages print tag
values verbatim rather than at the precision each comparison is read at.  Two of
its entries are controls on planted mutations: N4 plants M5's table with the
delta the page's own numbers imply, and N5 plants a correct third statement of
the lock G1 and G1b corrupt, so that each pair tests the rule it names rather
than the absence of any pairing or of any second statement at all.

Every fixture is a temporary copy — the pages themselves are never written.
