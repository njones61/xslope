"""Page config: docs/verification/rocscience.md (Rocscience Slide2 corpus).

Figure mode: ``panel``.  The corpus figures are a fixed two-panel composite —
model inputs on the left, the representative solution on the right — and every
caption says so ("inputs and ... solution", "inputs and the shallow mechanism"),
which is a layout claim the classifier reads back off the PNG.  The one
transient rapid-drawdown curve at VP102 is a single time-series axes whose
caption makes no layout claim, so it is named in ``caption_exempt``.
