"""Page config: docs/verification/rocscience_groundwater.md (RS2 groundwater).

Figure mode: ``panel``.  The corpus figures are a fixed two-panel composite —
mesh on the left, solved heads on the right — and the caption says exactly that,
so the caption makes a layout claim the classifier can read back off the PNG.
The transient/profile figures at the end of the page (isochrones, head along a
query line, an erfc profile) are plotted by different scripts at whatever panel
count the comparison needs and their captions make no layout claim, so each is
named in ``caption_exempt`` rather than left in a silent "other" bucket.
